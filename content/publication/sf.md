abstract = "We report numerical simulations based on  a non-Markovian density matrix propagation scheme of singlet fission (SF) in molecular crystals. This excitonic propagation technique was combined with ab-initio electronic structure calculations  to parametrize the exciton and phonon Hamiltonian as well as the exciton-phonon interactions. The interactions between the exciton and intramolecular and  intermolecular vibrations modes were both explicitly included in our simulations. We demonstrate that the intermolecular vibration modes can, in certain cases, significantly accelerate SF. This result may help understanding the fast SF experimentally observed in a broad range of molecular crystals and offers a new direction for the engineering of efficient SF sensitizers."
