abstract = "Quantum staes of trinaphtylene molecule were manipulted by putting its napthyl branches in contact with single Au Atoms. One Au atom carries 1-bit of classical information input that is converted into quantum information throughout the molecule The Au-trinaphtylene electronic itneractions give rise to measurable energy shifts of the molecular electronic states demonstrating a NOR logic gate functionality. The NOR truth table of the single molecule logic gate was characterized by means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy"
